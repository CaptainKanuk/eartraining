  <p class = "lead"> SuperTonic was written by a group of Princeton students who were frustrated with how outdated all of the ear-training websites are. No one should have to force themselves to learn about music - it should be fun! And so: <br> <h2> SuperTonic WAS BORN </h2></p> 
  <p class = "lead"> SuperTonic uses a selection of highly interactive games to make ear training addictive and easy. Users choose from game categories such as intervals, MORE STUFF LATER, and level up as they slowly become masters at that musical skill.  </p>
