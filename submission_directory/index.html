<P> Musicans, composers, and students of music theory have a great need to train their ear and musicianship skills, yet the software available to use for these purposes is outdated, inaccessible, and unusable. Mezzo attempts to change this by offering an interactive, fun, and beautiful approach to ear training. Using a modern interface and progressive games, Mezzo is fun and easy to use for musicans and non-musicians alike.

<P> Access Mezzo at http://ear-training.herokuapp.com

<P> Contact PM Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie at dgranizo@.

<P> These links must point to PDF files <b>with with exactly the
specified names</b>.  They must not require logging in to some place
like Google Docs or GitHub.  My goal is to have the submissions all in
one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
